<h2>About MyOSG</h2>
<p> The OSG has a plethora of tools that various groups develop, and use. OSG end users find a variety of these tools useful in their user experience. Unfortunately they find it hard to keep up with all the tools, and their accessibility; Similarly OSG support staff find it hard when they are trying to debug an issue related to a trouble ticket. Additionally, new collaborators at every level have repeatedly pointed out that most of these tools are hard to find, and that there is no one place that provides them with all the pieces of information they need, leading to having to maintain several bookmarks, or forgetting important information sources.</p>

<p>The Operations Information Center is intended to address some of these concerns. The primary idea is to use an authoritative source of information about OSG entities, and collate all possible tools to be accessible in a single web portal called MyOSG, where a user can visit, and access various pieces of information. MyOSG also provides the ability for users to export / subscribe to a variety of information in formats such as XML, CSV, and in industry standard widget formats (UWA). This will enable users of MyOSG to to construct Individual Infomation Centers (IICs) for on tools such as iGoogle, Netvibes, Opera Widgets, iPhone, etc.. The MyOSG will allow users to access only the information that matters to them in on a format that is once again most convenient to them. </p>
